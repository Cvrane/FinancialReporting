# FinancialReporting
A detailed report to clearly show the financial analysis and business operation of XYZ Capital and to forecast their gross billings in the Quarter 4 of 2013. 
 
## Introduction: 
This project focuses on forecasting financial and economic time series. Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. However, I decided to not go all the way believing that there is no hope for a machine learning model to train the time-series data. Considering the seasonal nature of the data, I could at least model the data, so that the predictions that I made correlate with the actual behavior of the data.
For making predictions I used the following methods to draw conclusions: 

### 1. Summary Data Analysis

### 2. Development Trend Analysis

### 3. Data Comparison Analysis

### 4. Progress Analysis

### 5. Final Remarks
